1. If you want to have title and description at sidebar or header, turn this on.
2. This adds the _featured image_ of the gallery to background of the details area and
3. You can choose if you want them to be at sidebar or at the top of the page.

**Note:** Some gallery types like slider don't offer that option since they are naturally full-screen.

## Ordering of photos

You might think of how to change the ordering of photos in a gallery. It is done using drag & drop while adding and editing photos of a gallery. At the live gallery customizer page, click on **Edit Gallery** and there you can drag & drop to order photos as you wish.![](../.gitbook/assets/2016-12-17_17-36-25.jpg)
