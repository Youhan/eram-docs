# Instagram widget

Here are the required steps to add an instagram feed to your page and also any other widget using Visual Composer:

1- Install and activate "WP Instagram Widget" if you haven't already, it will create a instagram widget on your site.

2- To show any widget in a page using Visual Composer, we need to create an area to display it which is a sidebar . It can be done in dashboard-&gt;appearance-&gt;customize-&gt;theme settings-&gt;sidebars.

Here you can create a sidebar and when you add this sidebar to a specific page, all of it's widgets will be visible. Create one for instagram and give it a proper name like "instagram sidebar". The name is just used for reference and it's not important.

3- Go to dashboard-&gt;appearance-&gt;widgets and you should see instagram widget in available widgets and also our newly created "instagram sidebar" on the right side. Just add the instagram widget to the "instagram sidebar" by drag and drop and then set it's settings. Here is a screenshot of the widget page:

The important settings are :

1- instagram username that you want to show it's feed.

2- size of the photos which is best to be set on thumbnail size to include in a page.

Lastly you will need to actually add that widget area to your page which can be done by Visual Composer "widgetized sidebar". Please edit the page you want to add widget to it and follow the below screenshots:
