# Full width row in Visual Composer

By default all row element contents are wrapped inside a container because that's the way it should be when you want to build a regular page \(contents are mostly contained\) but there are special pages like sliders and carousels that need to be fullwidth.

In this case we need to edit the related row in Visual Composer and set the "Row stretch" option to "Stretch row and content \( no padding\)" which you can see in the below screenshot:
