3. Your site name.  
4. The Site Icon is used as a browser and app icon for your site. Icons must be square, and at least 512 pixels wide and tall.

## Static Front page

By default WordPress shows recent posts in homepage and also has the capability of setting a static page as homepage. We also have added an extra option for setting portfolio or gallery archive as homepage.

If you want to change home to anything other than recent posts, **first you need to set it to a static page.** This can be done in Dashboard-&gt;appearance-&gt;Customize-&gt;Static Front Page :

## Coloring Options

There are two main color schemes available with the Eram theme.  
1. Light \(mainly white\)  
2. Dark

You can choose one of these color schemes, after that if you want to modify colors based on the selected scheme, you can enable the customization option and there is is possible to change main colors of the theme. To do more you need to use the custom css section and define your colors. Ask for support if you need more help on this.
