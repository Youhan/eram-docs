Click on any demo that you want to import and all pages, posts, galleries, portfolios, widgets and theme options will be added to your website.

## You might want to Rest!

In some cases you would like to try another demo while the contents of a demo is already imported to your website. You can remove all posts, pages, etc using [WordPress Reset](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-reset/) plugin. Be aware that this plugin resets the WordPress database back to it's defaults. Deletes all customizations and content. Does not modify files only resets the database.
